# Caltech 101 Faces

This dataset was originally downloaded from Caltech (L. Fei-Fei, R. Fergus and P. Perona. Learning generative visual models from few training examples: an incremental Bayesian approach tested on 101 object categories. IEEE. CVPR 2004, Workshop on Generative-Model Based Vision. 2004) then organized into separated directories refering to 20 individuals with more than 8 samples.

The goal of this repository is to facilitate the teaching of deep learning classes with organized data.

Please, refer the full dataset at [Caltech 101 Dataset](http://www.vision.caltech.edu/html-files/archive.html).

This dataset was adapted to use in Machine Learning classes. The generated output image removed and the directory structure was changed.
